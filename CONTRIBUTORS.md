Contributors
============

This project was started, because it is needed in many places.
Such a sensitive topic like security and authorisation deserves a lot of thought
which you can only get with full transparency.

I hope many people will add their thoughts in the github issues, as PRs or in 
any other way.

We are open to contributions, as long as they improve the project and make it
better for everybody.

All contributors will be credited via github in case of PRs, and here in this
file, if the contributor allows it.
